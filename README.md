# LinearInterpolation
In the process of condensed matter calculation, it is necessary to extend the Weyl point path. This program can be used to quickly calculate the straight line connecting the Weyl points. By customizing the zoom scale, the two endpoints of the line with different extension distances can be obtained. The output format has been set to be consistent with the wanniertools standard input file format.

1. A new function has been updated: through a Weyl point and a reciprocal lattice vector, a custom expansion factor is used to output the corresponding upper boundary endpoint of the straight line. This function can be used to study the body state of any Weyl point along any reciprocal lattice vector. 
2. Provides customization of the output format of the surface state path for both 100 and 001 surface states.

1. Fixed the positive and negative issues in Arc settings. Now the positive and negative are related to the path of the setting.
2. Fixed the bug of trigger.
